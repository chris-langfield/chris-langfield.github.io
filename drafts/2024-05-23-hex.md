**(profits as yet unrealized)*

This post will discuss the how and a little bit of the why for my latest project, a Python package called [hexfft](https://github.com/chris-langfield/hexfft/), which implements two types of
FFT for data sampled on a hexagonal 2D grid.

There are several interesting advantages to this sampling geometry. For regular hexagonal sampling, each point has 6 equidistant nearest neighbors, compared with 4 in square sampling. This scheme of tiling the 2D plane reduces grid edge effects and also for more flexible path-finding and boundary definitions. An oft-cited figure is that for a circularly bandlimited signal in the plane, 13.4% fewer samples are required to fully specify the spectrum, as a hexagonal bandregion more tightly encloses a circle than a square one.

Honeycomb-like structures are found throughout nature and science. Besides being highly aesthetically pleasing, this layout is used (or evolves naturally) when a maximally efficient coverage of the 2D plane is required. Two examples are the layout of electrodes on a probe used to detect electrical signals from neurons in the mouse brain, and the arrangement of optical fibers used to image galaxies (see below).
