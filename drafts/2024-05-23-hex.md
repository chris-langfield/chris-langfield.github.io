**(profits as yet unrealized)*

This post will discuss the how and a little bit of the why for my latest project, a Python package called [hexfft](https://github.com/chris-langfield/hexfft/), which implements two types of
FFT for data sampled on a hexagonal 2D grid.

| *Geometry of regular hexagonal sampling* |


There are several interesting advantages to this sampling geometry. For regular hexagonal sampling, each point has 6 equidistant nearest neighbors, compared with 4 in square sampling. This scheme of tiling the 2D plane reduces grid edge effects and also for more flexible path-finding and boundary definitions. An oft-cited figure is that for a circularly bandlimited signal in the plane, 13.4% fewer samples are required to fully specify the spectrum, as a hexagonal bandregion more tightly encloses a circle than a square one.

Honeycomb-like structures are found throughout nature and science. Besides being highly aesthetically pleasing, this layout is used (or evolves naturally) when a maximally efficient coverage of the 2D plane is required. Two examples are the layout of electrodes on a probe used to detect electrical signals from neurons in the mouse brain, and the arrangement of optical fibers used to image galaxies (see below).

The seminal paper on processing hexagonally sampled images is Mersereau's 1979 paper, [*The Processing of Hexagonally Sampled Two-Dimensional Signals*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1455625). Mersereau introduces an FFT algorithm for hexagonally sampled data on a hexagon-shaped (and hexagonally periodic in the plane) region of support. This was followed up by Erhardt's 1993 [*Hexagonal Fast Fourier Transform with Rectangular output*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/205759), which extends the method to regions with rectangular periodicity. These two algorithms are implemented in the `hexfft` library. Rummelt and Birdsong discovered and patented a coordinate system in which the hexagonal Fourier kernel is [separable](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7532670). There is also work covering transforms on hexagonal (and other) lattices by the [algebraic signal processing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17547130/) community. A 2005 book, [Hexagonal Image Processing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/1-84628-203-9), also covers the topic and introduces an array of fascinating and exotic hexagonal coordinate systems. 

As I became curious about this topic, I was surprised to find a lack of ready-to-use implementations of hexagonal FFTs. The closest I could find was [HexagDLy](https://github.com/ai4iacts/hexagdly) and the accompanying [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018302723) by Steppa and Holch (2019) which implements convolutions on hexagonal grids with an eye towards neural network processing of astronomical data. If `hexfft`'s niche has already been filled somewhere, I can only blame my own lack of Google savvy. 

# The mathematics of the hexagonal FFT

The exposition below closely follows sections 1.2 through 1.4 of [Multidimensional Signal Processing, 2nd ed.](https://search.worldcat.org/title/Multidimensional-digital-signal-processing/oclc/1319417381) by Dudgeon and Mersereau. 

## Coordinate system

Many coordinate systems for hexagonal grids have been proposed, both in the literature above and in the [programming community](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). Mersereau and Ehrhardt both use an *oblique* coordinate system where the y-axis is slanted 30 degrees from its usual position. In other words, we use the lattice on $\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by the vectors $(1, 0)$ and  $(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$. In this system, the gridpoints are laid out in a regular hexagonal pattern with a spacing of 1 between all nearest neighbors.

The plot above shows an 8x8 "square" in oblique coordinates (defined by ${x < 8, y < 8}$), corresponding to a parallelogram on the plane. 

## Sampling and periodicity

A lattice on $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be expressed as the integer linear combinations of any basis vectors $\mathbf{v_1}$ and $\mathbf{v_2}$. If a 2D discrete signal is composed of samples taken on a regular lattice, we can relate the discrete function $x: \mathbb{Z}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and the underlying continuous function $\tilde{x}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by defining 

$$
\begin{align*}
    V = \big( \mathbf{v_1} & | \mathbf{v_2} \big)
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
    x(\mathbf{n}) := \tilde{x}(V\mathbf{n})
\end{align*}
$$

For example, if a signal is sampled on a rectilinear grid with a spacing of 0.5 in the $x$ direction and $1$ in the $y$ direction, then

$$
\begin{align*}
    V = \begin{pmatrix}
        0.5 & 0 \\
        0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}
$$

The value of $x$ at the point $(1, 1)$ on the lattice is then given by

$$
\begin{align*}
    x(1, 1) = \tilde{x}(0.5, 1)
\end{align*}
$$

We refer to $V$ as the sampling matrix. For a general hexagonal lattice with spacings $d_1$ and $d_2$ in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, 

$$
\begin{align*}
    V = \begin{pmatrix}
        d_1 & -\frac{d_1}{2} \\
        0 & d_2
        \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}
$$

If $d_1 = d_2 = 1$, then this reduces to 

$$
\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -0.5 \\
        0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

The `hexshow()` function in `hexfft.plot` uses this grid to display hexagonal arrays as there is a convenient correspondence between array indices and physical distance between points. For regular hexagonal spacing, where the distance between each point and its six neighbors is 1, 

$$
\begin{align*}
    V = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -1/2\\
    0 &\sqrt{3}/2
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

## Discrete Fourier Transforms on Lattices

A signal $x: \mathbb{Z}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is periodic with periodicity matrix $P$ if for any integer vector $\mathbf{r}$, 

$$
\begin{align*}
    x(\mathbf{n}) = x(\mathbf{n} + P\mathbf{r})
\end{align*}
$$

For a periodic signal regardless of sampling strategy, we use the definition of the 2D discrete Fourier transform pair given in \cite{Ehrhardt_1993}, \cite{Mersereau_Speake_1981} :

$$
\begin{align}
    X(k_1, k_2) = \sum_{n_1} \sum_{n_2} x(n_1, n_2) \exp\big(-2\pi i \mathbf{k}^T P^{-1} \mathbf{n}\big) \\
    x(n_1, n_2) = \frac{1}{\det P}\sum_{k_1} \sum_{k_2} X(k_1, k_2) \exp\big(2\pi i \mathbf{k}^T P^{-1} \mathbf{n}\big)
\end{align}
$$

The normalizing element $\frac{1}{\det P}$ corresponds to the area of one periodic unit of the signal. It is easy to see that this form reduces to the usual DFT and IDFT for square sampling on an $N$ by $N$ grid, 

$$
\begin{align*}
P = N\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

This form is agnostic to the specific geometry of the lattice (the sampling matrix $V$ does not come into the equations). It is crucial, however, for interpreting the output of the Fourier transform. 

## Mersereau's HexFFT kernel

Consider a hexagonally periodic signal with period $N$ in both dimensions. Then in oblique coordinates, the periodicity matrix is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
       P = N\begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 1 \\
        1 & 2
        \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
        P^{-1} = \frac{1}{3N}\begin{pmatrix}
        2 & -1 \\
        -1 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Then we have

$$
\begin{align*}
    X(k_1, k_2) = \sum_{n_1} \sum_{n_2} x(n_1, n_2) \exp\bigg(-\frac{2\pi i}{3N}\begin{pmatrix}
  k_1\\
  k_2
\end{pmatrix}^{T} \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & -1\\
        -1 & 2
        \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  n_1\\
  n_2\end{pmatrix} \bigg) 
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
    = \sum_{n_1} \sum_{n_2} x(n_1, n_2) \exp\bigg(-\frac{2\pi i}{3N} \big(2 k_1 n_1 + 2 k_2 n_2 - k_1 n_2 - k_2 n_2\big) \bigg)
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
    = \sum_{n_1} \sum_{n_2} x(n_1, n_2) \exp\bigg(-\pi i \bigg(\frac{(2 k_1 - k_2)(2 n_1 - n_2)}{3N} + \frac{k_2 n_2}{N}\bigg) \bigg)
\end{align}
$$

Where $n_1, n_2 \in R_H(N)$
