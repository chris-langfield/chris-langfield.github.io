I am a [research software engineer](https://us-rse.org/) at the [International Brain Lab](https://github.com/int-brain-lab) based at Columbia University. I studied applied mathematics at the University of Rochester. I'm primarily interested in signal and image processing, computational mathematics, and scientific software.
