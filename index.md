I am a Research Software Engineer at Princeton University, based in the Program for Computational and Applied Mathematics. I work full-time on [ASPIRE](https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python), an open-source Python package which processes and reconstructs cryo-electron microscopy data. ASPIRE uses numerical libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and [FINUFFT](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft), along with novel image processing algorithms to reconstruct the 3D structure of macromolecules from thousands of noisy projections:
