I am a research software engineer at Princeton University, in the Program for Applied and Computational Mathematics. I studied applied mathematics at the University of Rochester. A few of my interests, along with related papers/links (under construction):

* Mathematical modeling, especially in biology
* Signal and image processing 
* Scientific software development (see the [ASPIRE](https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python) software package, to which I am a contributor)
* Heterodox economics: [The complexity of exchange](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.593.3725&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
