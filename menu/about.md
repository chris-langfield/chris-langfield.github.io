I am a [research software engineer](https://us-rse.org/) at Princeton University, in the Program for Applied and Computational Mathematics. I studied applied mathematics at the University of Rochester. A few of my interests, along with related papers/links (under construction):

* Applied mathematics, especially mathematical biology and mathematical physics
* Signal and image processing 
* Scientific software development (see the [ASPIRE](https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python) software package, to which I am a contributor)
* Heterodox economics: [The complexity of exchange](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.593.3725&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

### EMS

I am a New York State certified emergency medical technician. From 2018 to 2021 I was proud to work as an EMT with Richmond County Ambulance and with Northwell Health in the NYC 911 system.
