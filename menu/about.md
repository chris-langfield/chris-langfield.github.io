I am a [research software engineer](https://us-rse.org/) at the [International Brain Lab](https://github.com/int-brain-lab) based at Columbia University. I studied applied mathematics at the University of Rochester. I'm interested in:

* Signal and image processing
* Applied mathematics, especially mathematical biology and mathematical physics
* Scientific software development
